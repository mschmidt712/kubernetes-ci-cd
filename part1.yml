parts:

  - name: Part 1
    intro: In this part we will setup a local cluster with minikube, deploy a public image from dockerhub, customize that image, and then finally deploy it inside our local cluster.
    steps:

      - cap: Start up the Kubernetes cluster with Minikube, giving it some extra resources.
        com: minikube start --memory 8000 --cpus 2

      - cap: Enable the Minikube add-ons Heapster and Ingress.
        com: minikube addons enable heapster; minikube addons enable ingress

      - cap: Wait 20 seconds, and then view the Minikube Dashboard, a web UI for managing deployments.
        com: sleep 20; minikube service kubernetes-dashboard --namespace kube-system

      - cap: Deploy the public nginx image from DockerHub into a pod. Nginx is an open source web server that will automatically download from Docker Hub if it’s not available locally.
        com: kubectl run nginx --image nginx --port 80

      - cap: Create a service for deployment. This will expose the nginx pod so you can access it with a web browser.
        com: kubectl expose deployment nginx --type NodePort --port 80

      - cap: Launch a web browser to test the service. The nginx welcome page displays, which means the service is up and running.
        com: minikube service nginx

      - cap: Set up the cluster registry by applying a .yml manifest file.
        com: kubectl apply -f manifests/registry.yml

      - cap: Wait for the registry to finish deploying. Note that this may take several minutes.
        com: kubectl rollout status deployments/registry

      - cap: View the registry user interface in a web browser.
        com: minikube service registry-ui

      - cap: Let’s make a change to an HTML file in the cloned project. Running the command below will open /applications/hello-kenzan/index.html in the nano text editor. Change some text inside one of the <p> tags. For example, change “Hello from Kenzan!” to “Hello from Me!”. When you’re done, press Ctrl+X to close the file, type Y to confirm the filename, and press Enter to write the changes to the file.
        com: nano applications/hello-kenzan/index.html

      - cap: Now let’s build an image, giving it a special name that points to our local cluster registry.
        com: docker build -t 127.0.0.1:30400/hello-kenzan:latest -f applications/hello-kenzan/Dockerfile applications/hello-kenzan

      - cap: We’ve built the image, but before we can push it to the registry, we need to set up a temporary proxy. By default the Docker client can only push to HTTP (not HTTPS) via localhost. To work around this, we’ll set up a container that listens on 127.0.0.1:30400 and forwards to our cluster.
        com: docker stop socat-registry; docker rm socat-registry; docker run -d -e "REGIP=`minikube ip`" --name socat-registry -p 30400:5000 chadmoon/socat:latest bash -c "socat TCP4-LISTEN:5000,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:`minikube ip`:30400"

      - cap: With our proxy container up and running, we can now push our image to the local repository.
        com: docker push 127.0.0.1:30400/hello-kenzan:latest

      - cap: The proxy’s work is done, so you can go ahead and stop it.
        com: docker stop socat-registry;

      - cap: With the image in our cluster registry, the last thing to do is apply the manifest to create and deploy the hello-kenzan pod based on the image.
        com: kubectl apply -f applications/hello-kenzan/k8s/deployment.yaml

      - cap: Launch a web browser and view the service.
        com: minikube service hello-kenzan
